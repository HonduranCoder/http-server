# http-server
Create an http server using the built-in http module in node. It will:

Delegate requests for different API resource routes using an object map.</br>
Use a router object with methods that correspond to HTTP methods (so it can be called dynamically as an object map). </br>
Parse the request body for incoming POST and PUT methods. </br>
Use your SimpleDb for persisting and retrieving the data associated with the resource.</br>
